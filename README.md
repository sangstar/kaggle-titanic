# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This is my submission for the [Titanic challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) from Kaggle. The main notebook of interest is `main.ipynb`

My current best score is at 78%, which I may look to improve. That places me at about the 80th percentile of scores.
